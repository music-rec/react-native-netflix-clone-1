### This is a work in progress

- About: A Netflix clone developed with React Native, developed from scratch, without any UI library. It uses a mock data to avoid a backend layer and to anyone run the app in their machine without the need to configure a web server.

- We are using redux-saga to control navigation flow, user authentication and requests to our fake data.
